# Instructions

To install PCC-FECalc from source, clone the repository and install the package in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arminshzd/PCC-FECalc.git
cd PCC-FECalc
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** PyMOL is required but not installed automatically because no pip wheel is available. Install PyMOL separately from [pymol.org](https://www.pymol.org/) or the open-source repository at [github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source), and ensure the `pymol` executable is on your `PATH`.
