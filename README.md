# PCC-FECalc: Binding Free Energy Calculations for Protein-Catalyzed Capture Agents

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository provides a python framework for performing binding free energy calculations for a user-defined target molecule and a protein-catalyzed capture (PCC) agent with a user-defined epitope sequence. The core of this package is based on ["High-throughput virtual screening of protein-catalyzed capture agents for novel hydrogel-nanoparticle fentanyl sensors"](10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-psxft) and the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/Ferg-Lab/FEN-HTVS). Please refer to the original paper for a more technical explanation of the theory and the setup behind the free energy calculations done with this framework.

## ðŸš€ Features

The framework is organized into four main submodules that work in serial to perform a complete binding free energy calculation using GROMACS:

- `PCCBuilder`: This object creates a PCC with a given sequence, calculates GAFF2 parameters for it, and minimizes it.
- `TargetMOL`: Similar to `PCCBuilder`, creates input structures and force field parameters for a provided target molecule.
- `FECalc`: Brings together the PCC and the target molecule, solvates them in a water box, and performs minimization, NVT, and NPT equilibration, runs a parallel-bias metadynamics simulation, and reweights the resulting trajectory for free energy calculations.
- `postprocess`: Uses the reweighted statistics to calculate the 3D binding free energy volume of the PCC-molecule complex and calculates the binding free energy and dissociation constant.

## ðŸ›  Usage

See `example/pcc_submit_test.py` for a sample calculation setup.

Apart from the necessary python packages, this frameworks needs a `pymol` installation for PCC mutations, `packmol` for packing the PCC and target in a box, and `acpype` to calculate GAFF2 parameters. The path to the `pymol` installation can be set through `FECalc/PCCBuilder_settings.JSON` and the setup for running `packmol` and `acpype` are set by `FECalc/mold/complex/mix/run_packmol.sh` and `FECalc/mold/PCC/sub_acpype.sh`.

The calculations happen through four steps and each step requires a `JSON` files with the necessary user parameters:

### Step 1: Building the PCC

The settings file for this step is pre-made in `FECalc/PCCBuilder_settings.JSON`. You shouldn't need to change anything here except the `pymol_dir` which should include the command to call `pymol`.

### Step 2: Building the target

The settings file for this step should be created by the user. Two example are provided in `example/ACT_settings.JSON` for acetaminophen and `example/FEN_settings.JSON` for fentanyl. The mandatory entries are:

- `name`: Name of the target. Used for creating subdirectories and making reports.
- `charge`: Total charge of the target.
- `anchor1`: Anchor point defined using the atoms on the target molecule. This is used together with `anchor2` to define a vector that is used in determining the relative position and orientation of the target molecule with respect to the PCC during the PBMetaD calculations. See the original publication for a detailed explanation of how this vector is used in the collective variables.
- `anchor2`: See above.
- `output_dir`: Path to the folder to store the parameter calculations and minimization.
- `input_pdb_dir`: Input `pdb` file of the target molecule structure.

### Step 3: Free energy calculations

The settings file for this step should be created by the user. An example is provided in `example/system_settings.JSON`. The mandatory entries are:

- `PCC_output_dir`: Path to the output folder that holds the PCC calculations.
- `PCC_settings_json`: Path to the `JSON` file for the PCC.
- `MOL_settings_json`: Path to the `JSON` file for the target.
- `temperature`: Temperature of the simulations
- `box_size`: Size of the simulation box. Cubic periodic.
- `complex_output_dir`: Path to the out directory for the free energy calculations. The contents of this directory will be as follows:

output_folder_name/
â”‚-- em/               # Minimization
â”‚-- nvt/              # NVT equilibration
â”‚-- npt/              # NPT equilibration
â”‚-- md/               # PBMetaD simulation
â”‚-- reweight/         # Reweighting

The optional entries are:

- `metad_settings`: Parameters of the metadynamics simulation
  - `n_steps`: Number of steps for the metadynamics run. 2 fs step size. defaults to 800 ns.
  - `metad_height`: Height of the deposited Guassians. Defaults to 3.0 kJ/mol.
  - `metad_pace`: Pace of deposition. Defaults to 500 steps.
  - `metad_bias_factor`: Biasing factor for the PBMetaD bias. Defaults to 20.
- `postprocess_settings`: Parameters for the post-processing and free energy calculations.
  - `discard_initial`: Initial duration of the PBMetaD simulation to discard for free energy calculations in ns. Defaults to 100 ns.
  - `n_folds`: Number of folds for block-analysis and uncertainty quantification. Defaults to 5.
